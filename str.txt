The price of a subway ticket ranges from three yuan to six yuan when travelling distance is below 32 km. People who go further need to pay one yuan for every 20 km.
At present, the city has a flat rate subway fare with unlimited transfers. To ease traffic congestion ahead of the Olympics in 2008, Beijing reduced bus tickets to as low as four jiao (six cents) and two yuan for subway tickets. Since then, prices have not changed.
Frequent commuters can receive discounts ranging from 20 percent to 50 percent depending on the monthly amount they spend on the subway, authorities said.
